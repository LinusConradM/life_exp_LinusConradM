# Abstract

Here, i re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002)

# Life Expectancy Analysis


The code finds, for each year in the Gapminder dataset, the country with the highest life expectancy. It then creates a table showing the year, that countryâ€™s name, and the corresponding maximum life expectancy in chronological order.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
sumdat <- gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year)
```
